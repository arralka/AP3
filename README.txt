Each part has a corresponding file to run:

Part 1: python3 run_part1.py
Part 2: python3 run_part2.py
Part 3: python3 run_part3.py

Within each file you are able to edit the arguments (Artist, Ngram number, Chorus structure, etc)
Pleasure ensure all relevant libraries are installed first (requirements.txt)
