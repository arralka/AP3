You take
You take
Away
Away

Why does this feels
Night today (day, day, day, day)
Something in here's not right today (day, day, day, day)
Why does this feels
Night today (day, day, day, day)
Paranoia's all I got left (left, left, left, left, left)

Left, right
Left, right
Left, right
Left, right
Left, right
Left, right
Left, right

You take
You take
Away
Away
Away
Away
Away

This is so fun
This whole project is like fun
Did that sound good?
That's right
