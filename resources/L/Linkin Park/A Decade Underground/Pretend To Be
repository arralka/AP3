You say that you're proud of me
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
And you take something out of me
So predictable
Why do I have to see this through?
Why do I have to take this?
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this?

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be

You start with apologies
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
Then take another shot at me
So predictable
Why do I have to see this through?
Why do I have to take this?
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this?

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend this
No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be

Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend this
No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
You're not the one that you pretend to be
