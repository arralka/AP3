Myself
Myself

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again

By myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

I can't look around
It's too much to take in
I can't hold back
When I'm stretched so thin
I can't slow down
Watching everything spin
I can't look back
Starting over again

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

By myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

I can't look around
It's too much to take in
I can't hold back
When I'm stretched so thin
I can't slow down
Watching everything spin
I can't look back
Starting over again

Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it right
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it right
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it right
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it right
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it right
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it right
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside
