All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, to look behind

All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, to look behind

If you go, there's no turning back
If you go, there's no turning back
If you go, there's no turning back
There's no turning back

No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no turning back
No, no turning back
No, no turning back
No, no turning back

All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind

All of these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, can't look behind
