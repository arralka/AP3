Looked in the ocean
Looked in the sea
Found her laughing
Watching for me
Left the door open
Left the door wide
As she often
Kept it inside

And if you're badder than fact phone z
Phend it back to me
Sitting front pitter badder than b
Even badder than phint to phone badder
Than the patter in friends
Who gutter the prat
The Friday on the patter you plumped
You're getting thrown even badder than bomb
Don't trust
If you don't, than your fighting for what?

[2x]
We're fighting for a place
That we can call home
Looking for a way
Not to be alone

Not to be alone

Dun na na
Dun na na na na na na na
Dun na na
Dun na na na na na na na
Dun na na na na

[2x]
We're fighting for a place
That we can call home
Looking for a way
Not to be alone

Not to be alone
