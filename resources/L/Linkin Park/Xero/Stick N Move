[Mike Shinoda:]
This is how it's done going for the title and crown
Renowned MCs surround as the beat breaks down
In 2 elements clubbin' up those that bring the best and that's
Am I see the way it ought to be finessed?
Yes

Yes, am I the one to keep you on your toes?
Most definitely in my b-boy pose
It's the electric boogaloo with a slight twist
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this

[Mark Wakefield:]
Now see what I have, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
Now see what I had, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move

[Mike Shinoda:]
MCs dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic
Now it's like: you sit, you stay
Cobra Kai fly styles I'm kicking
Stickin' MCs real quick 'cause time's tickin'

At the drop of the defense, I let loose the venom
Sendin' a shot of verbal heat up in 'em
The ending is done, grab your family and run
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots at the sun

Record industry rule four-thousand-eighty-one
Question my intentions and your whole world is done
Like Forrest you'll run, turn your eyeballs into Saturn
Full Metal Jacket fully auto-rhyme pattern

[Mark Wakefield:]
Now see what I have, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
Now see what I had, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move

[Mike Shinoda:]
Stick it, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Move it, moving all the tunes and you groove it
[4x]

[Mark Wakefield:]
Now see what I have, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
Now see what I had, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
