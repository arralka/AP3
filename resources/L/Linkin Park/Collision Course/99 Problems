[Jay-Z:]
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

Got 'em, Mike

[Mike Shinoda:]
He's got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure his casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's "Money, Cash, Hoes"
He's from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatoes
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
So fuck critics, you can kiss the whole asshole
If you don't like the lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if we don't play they show
They don't play our hits - we don't give a shit, so!
All these mags try and use our ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers!
I don't know what you take us as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
From, rags to riches, we ain't dumb
We got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

[Jay-Z and Mike Shinoda]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

[Jay-Z (Mike Shinoda):]
Now the year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw
In the rear-view mirror is the motherfuckin' law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or (or?)
Bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor (c'mon!)
And I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So, I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Or do I look like a mind reader sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?
(Well, you was doing fifty-five in the fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are)
I ain't stepping out of shit, all my papers legit
(Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?)
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
(Aren't you sharp as a tack!
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?)
Ha, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
(Well, we'll see how smart you are when the canines come)
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

[Jay-Z and Mike Shinoda:]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

[Jay-Z:]
Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no God damn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'mma get to clapping and
He and his boys gon' be yapping to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratching again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snapping them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill' for bail 'cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassing them
Trying to play the boy like he's saccharin
But ain't nothing sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems bein' a bitch ain't one - hit me!

[Jay-Z and Mike Shinoda:]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

[Chester Bennington:]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
I'm about to break!

[Chester Bennington (Jay-Z):]
Everything you say to me
(I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!)
I need a little room to breathe
(I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!)
Everything you say to me
(I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!)
I need a little room to breathe
(I got 99 problems)
And I'm about to...
Break
