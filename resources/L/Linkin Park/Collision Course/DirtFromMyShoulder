[Chester Bennington:]
I ordered a frappuccino
Where's my fucking frappuccino?
Alright, let's do this

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
(When I pretend), I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can

But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just (trying to bend the truth)
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be,
So I'm (lying my way from—)

[Jay-Z:]
Yeah, if you feeling like a pimp nigga
Go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too
Go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy, baby, don't forget that, boy
Told you get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all
Proud to be locked by the force
Trying to hustle some things
That go with the Porsche

Feeling no remorse
Feeling like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law
Nigga gripping my balls

Said the ladies they love me
From the bleachers they screaming
All the ballers is bouncing
They like the way I be leaning

All the rappers be hating
Off the track that I'm making
But all the hustlers—they love it
Just to see one of us make it

Came from the bottom the bottom
To the top of the pops
Nigga London, Japan
And I'm straight off the block

Like a running back, get it man
I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga
'Cause I'm straight with the Roc

If you feeling like a pimp, nigga
Go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too
Go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy, baby, don't forget that, boy
Told you get that dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get (get) that (that) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (get) that (that) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (get) that (that) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (get) that (that) dirt off your shoulder

Your homey Hov' in position
In the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch
Trying to get me a Rover

Trying to stretch out the coca
Like a wrestler, yes, sir
Keep the Heckler close
You know them smokers'll test ya

But like fifty-two cards went out
I'm through dealing
Now fifty-two bars come out
Now you feel 'em
Now fifty-two cars roll out
Remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out
Now you chilling
With a boss,
bitch, of course
S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club
ESPN on the screen

I paid a grip for the jeans
Plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels
I'm a grown-up for real, chill

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
Yeah, I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in

And now you think this person really is me
And I'm (trying to bend the truth)
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm (lying my way from you)

[Chester Bennington (Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda):]
(No, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so, let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life
I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own
'Cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you—
The very worst part of you is me

[Mike Shinoda:]
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this
This isn't what I wanted to be,
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

This isn't what I wanted to be,
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this
This isn't what I wanted to be,
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

[Chester Bennington (Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda):]
You
(No turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so, let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life
I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own
'Cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you—
The very worst part of you is me

[Jay-Z:]
Bitch
