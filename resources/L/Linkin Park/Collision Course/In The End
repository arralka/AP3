[Mike Shinoda:]
This is fun

Ladies and gentlemen, put our hands together for the astonishing...

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 8th Wonder of the World
The flow of the century... always timeless... Hove!
(That's a hustle!)
Thank you for comin' out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with us
We appreciate that

[Jay-Z:]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbin' em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Boy and we got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me
Therefore he doesn't exist
So poof... vamoose son of a bitch

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get you damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty ya'll got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
Check it out, yo
(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
(All I know)
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
(And it's so unreal)
I didn't look out below
I watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, and didn't even know
I wasted it all just to
(Watch you go)
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually
Be a memory
Of a time when I tried, so

[Jay-Z:]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, help me out
Oh, they havin' good old time out there
It starts with
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, help me out
Oh, they havin' good old time out there
It starts with
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, help me out
Ye-ye-yes!
Ladies and gentleman
It starts with
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Oh, they havin' good old time out there
