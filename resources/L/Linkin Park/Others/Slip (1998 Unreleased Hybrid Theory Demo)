In the center of the silence
Violent thoughts are thrown through
The thick smoke and flickering lights that brighten the room
All the things that you wanted to say get lost and thrown away
You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind
Can't turn back when you cross the line
Sometimes there's someone you know who just doesn't care
Has to see you go to know you were there

This is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it
Feel that this is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it

I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong

Sometimes you got no control of where you go
Taken down a road you don't know
And you feel so lost that you wanna hide your face
You don't recognize the place your in
Sometimes the sun doesn't shine your way
Sometimes the night doesn't turn to day
But sometimes the light's so bright it burns through the night
And keeps the darkness at bay (far away)

This is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it
Feel that this is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it

I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them with me

Follow the link in the chain without a name
Still alight the darkened days' remains
Taken away from the place you've been trapped
Break all you know to bring it all back

This is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it
Feel that this is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it

I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them alone with me
