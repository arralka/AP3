Writing with a head full of buckets of red
And what I said is still stuck in my head
A thoroughbred, thoroughly bled,
And led to the land of the never-come-backs
Smaller than a thumbtack, and they never run from that
From planetary signs, rising over the horizon,
Smaller than a fly's head
I'm a lyrical lamb, the power of a god
In my cynical hand
With a pen, once again swimmin'
In the centre of a hit or a miss
Reeling in my thoughts gettin' lost in the mist
Realise that one the size of the fist
And the killin' of a killer with a flick of the wrist

I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I,
Live for them
(Still I see that it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

And the second is gone
The weapon of time is stronger than a nuclear bomb
Eternity or half-life
Somethin' that math can't write
You can't fight nor flee
Still be around if it wasn't for me
Weigh that, verse whatever, my friends
So you can see the attraction of the payback
Don't want me to say that?
Play back the thing now, gettin' lost in the chaos
Tossin' it down,

Singin' again to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic of my confine

Singin' again to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic of my confine

I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I,
Live for them
(Still I see that it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room heal my wounds [8x]

I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I
Live for them
(Still I see that it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

Burn! [4x]

Singin' again to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic of my confine

Singin' again to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic of my confine
