[Chester Bennington:]
It starts with one
[Mike Shinoda:]
And multiplies 'til you can taste the sun
And burned by the sky you try to take it from
But if it falls, there's no place to run
Crumbling down, it's so unreal

[Chester Bennington:]
It's so unreal
[Mike Shinoda:]
They're dealing you in to determine your end
And sending you back again, the places you've been
And bending your will 'til it breaks you within
And still they fill their eyes

[Chester Bennington:]
Fill their eyes
[Mike Shinoda:]
With the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad with the way I feel

[Chester Bennington:]
The way I feel
[Mike Shinoda:]
Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As it's seeming that you've played your part
Like you're heartless, take apart this
In the darkness but I know that I've tried so hard

[Chester Bennington:]
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

[Mike Shinoda:]
I've looked down the line
And what's there is not what ought to be
Held back by the battles they fought for me
Calling me to be part of their property
And now I see that I get no chance

[Chester Bennington:]
Get no chance
[Mike Shinoda:]
I get no break
Fakes and snakes quickly lead to mistakes
And as the tightrope within
Slowly starts to thin
I can only hope that they close their eyes

[Chester Bennington:]
Close their eyes
[Mike Shinoda:]
To the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad to the way I feel

[Chester Bennington:]
The way I feel
[Mike Shinoda:]
Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As it's seeming that you've played your part
Like you're heartless, take apart this
In the darkness, but I know that I tried so hard

[Chester Bennington:]
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
