In the dark days
I'll part ways
With the blame.
Trying to maintain
But it's still all the same
It's all a game.
Hear my name in the rain
And the pain,
I wear my face with a tear stain

You feign fondness, honestly it's time
To give you a piece of my mind
And show you that you're blind.
And in the design
Of the world I call mine
Know that you can't stand on both sides
Of the line.

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces
Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Pass all the blame over to me
It will come eventually
Take the time out to examine
All these questions honestly

With my eyes shut
I'm seeing the truth in your words
The absurd
Slurred into beauty to be heard
You swim through deceit
The lies that you tell
The stories you sell
Knowing you well
I keep distance
And every instance
You keep your thoughts concealed
What I feel
Just another spoke in the wheel
All or nothing
Thrown down and trampled by your heel
And eaten away
By my own version of the real

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces
Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Pass all the blame over to me
It will come eventually
Take the time out to examine
All these questions honestly

You're always to blame?

Nothing, thrown down
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Trampled by your heel
(Play the game and wear the tear stain)
Eaten by my own
(Pass the pain, 'cause you'll feel it if you don't)
Version of the real
(Stop counting 'til you've got your own)

Nothing, thrown down
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Trampled by your heel
(Play the game and wear the tear stain)
Eaten by my own
(Pass the pain, 'cause you'll feel it if you don't)
Version of the real
(Stop counting 'til you've got your own)
